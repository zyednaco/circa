            <img class="about-band-image" src="images/Circa-Survive-aboout.jpg">
            <p>Circa Survive is an American rock band from Philadelphia formed in 2004.
            The band, led by Anthony Green, consists of former members from Saosin, This Day Forward, and Taken.
            Circa Survive quickly made a name for themselves in the indie music scene in little over two years with their 2005 debut album, 
            Juturna, and second album, On Letting Go, released in 2007. Both albums were released on Equal Vision Records. 
            Their third album, Blue Sky Noise, was released via Atlantic Records in 2010. After parting ways with Atlantic Records, 
            the band's fourth album, Violent Waves, was released independently in 2012. Their fifth album, Descensus, was released 
            by Sumerian Records in 2014, and their sixth, The Amulet, with Hopeless Records in October 2017.</p>
            <p>Vocalist Anthony Green left the band Saosin, in 2004, later noting "the big thing was that I was just scared. 
            I was scared of committing".[2] Green met up with Colin Frangicetto, a friend with whom he had "jammed" during his stay, and they 
            decided to begin recording and recruiting. Thus, Circa Survive was born.Frangicetto and Green, with full support from Equal Vision Records,
            en recruited Brendan Ekstrom. Ekstrom had been Frangicetto's bandmate in This Day Forward, which had recently disbanded. Both Ekstrom and 
            Frangicetto had toured with Taken during their This Day Forward days, and procured Nick Beard, the previous bass guitarist of Taken, 
            as Circa Survive's next member. The band met Stephen Clifford through Vadim Taver of the band Marigold (and also from This Day Forward); 
            "Steve jammed with us for a week and from there it was on," said Frangicetto. Circa Survive's first release was the EP, 
            The Inuit Sessions, on March 18, 2005. It contained four tracks: "Act Appalled", "Handshakes at Sunrise", 
            "The Great Golden Baby", and "Suspending Disbelief". </p>
